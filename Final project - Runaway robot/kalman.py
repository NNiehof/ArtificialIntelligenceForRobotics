class Kalman:
    """
    Kalman filter for estimating location on a 2D plane.
    Location predictions are made in 2 positional dimensions: x and y (observed).
    Velocities dx and dy and optional further derivatives are unobserved,
    but included as dimensions in the model.

    Args:
        loc (array of int or float): array that contains the initial location
        estimates x and y, followed by any number of derivative terms.
        The estimates for derivatives may be set to zeros, for example
        `[x, y, 0, 0]` for a model with x, y, dx and dy.
        The length of this array will dictate the dimensionality of the
        Kalman filter. The above example will result in a 4D model.

    Optional args:
        var (array of int or float): initial variance estimate for location
            of size `dim`, where `dim` is the number of dimensions in the
            model.
            Default is 0 for the position terms (no location error), and 1000
            for derivative terms.
            error).
        dt (int or float): time step between states. Default is 1.
        motion_err (array of int or float): displacement effect by an unknown
            external source, such as external motion. Default is zeros, size
            is `dim`.
        sense_err (array of int or float): measurement noise. Default is
            [0.1, 0.1], size is `m` where `m` is the number of measurements per
            time point. `m` = 2 for the 2D case, as x and y are observed,
            but not dx and dy.
